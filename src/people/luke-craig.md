Luke is a primary school teacher in London who has seen the power of Apps Script to save teachers time in the education sector. He learnt to use apps script with the help of Ben Collins' online courses!

Loves to learn new things and tries to pass that on to his students. Enjoys watching chess videos on YouTube, taking part in triathlons, reading as many books as he can get his hands on and exploring the world.
