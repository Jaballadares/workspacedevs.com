I am a professional G Suite Consultant with 20+ years of experience. I've spent my career as a Software Engineer, Developer Relations Engineer, Technical Support Engineer, Technical Instructor, IT Manager, G Suite Administrator and currently as a Developer Consultant providing customized G Suite solutions. These solutions enable Small Business, Education and Non-Profit organizations to automate workflow and drive productivity. I was an early adopter of G Suite for Business and for Education as well as an early advocate of Google Apps Script (being a semi-finalist in the 2012 Google Apps Developer Competition and publishing a Google Docs add-on in 2014). In my free time I love to share my knowledge through publishing open source automation solutions and occasional blogging.
