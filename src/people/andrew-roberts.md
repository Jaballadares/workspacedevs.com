I have been professionally developing software since the early 90s. Starting out on low-level software and device drivers I've now moved "up the stack" and specialise in helping businesses automate their processes with Google Workspace and Apps Script. My consultancy is based in one of the remoter corners of the UK in West Wales, but with broadband having finally reached me I am able to be an active member of the Apps Script community. I recently started the Apps Script Slack channel and a database of Apps Script libraries.
